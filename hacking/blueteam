🔒 1. Preventive Operations (Hardening & Protection)
✅ Asset Inventory Management
Maintain an up-to-date list of all systems, applications, services, and endpoints.

Classify and tag sensitive assets (e.g. PCI, HIPAA).

✅ Patch Management
Regularly update OS, applications, firmware, and libraries.

Prioritize critical CVEs using CVSS scores and exploit availability.

✅ Configuration Hardening
Enforce security baselines (e.g. CIS Benchmarks).

Disable unnecessary services, ports, and default credentials.

✅ Firewall and Network Segmentation
Apply strict ACLs, VLANs, and zone-based firewalls.

Isolate critical infrastructure from general access networks.

✅ Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Deployment
Install and configure agents like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, or Microsoft Defender ATP.

Enable behavioral detection, file integrity monitoring, and memory scanning.

✅ Email and Web Filtering
Implement anti-phishing tools (e.g. Proofpoint, Mimecast).

Block malicious URLs and restrict file types.

✅ Access Control and Identity Management
Enforce MFA, RBAC, and least privilege.

Monitor login behaviors and implement identity federation (e.g. SSO with Okta/Azure AD).

🕵️‍♀️ 2. Detective Operations (Monitoring & Hunting)
🔍 Log Management and SIEM Monitoring
Collect and analyze logs using a SIEM like Splunk, Elastic, QRadar, or Azure Sentinel.

Build detection rules for abnormal behavior (e.g. brute force, lateral movement).

🔍 Security Monitoring & Alert Triage
Monitor alerts from IDS/IPS (e.g. Suricata, Snort).

Investigate alerts and suppress false positives.

🔍 Threat Hunting
Conduct proactive searches using known TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK).

Use hypotheses like: “What if an attacker compromised RDP last week?”

🔍 Anomaly Detection
Use baselining and UEBA (User & Entity Behavior Analytics).

Flag deviations in login times, process chains, or network destinations.

🔍 Threat Intelligence Integration
Pull in IOCs from OSINT, commercial feeds, or ISACs.

Correlate with logs and asset data to check for matches.

🧯 3. Responsive Operations (Containment & Recovery)
🚨 Incident Detection & Response
Follow IR playbooks (e.g. phishing, ransomware, lateral movement).

Classify severity and escalate accordingly.

🚨 Digital Forensics
Acquire memory, disk, or network captures for investigation.

Use tools like Volatility, FTK Imager, or Velociraptor.

🚨 Containment & Eradication
Isolate compromised hosts from the network.

Remove malicious files, accounts, or persistence mechanisms.

🚨 Recovery and Remediation
Reimage systems or restore from known-good backups.

Rotate credentials and patch exploited vulnerabilities.

🚨 Post-Incident Review (Lessons Learned)
Conduct after-action reports.

Update detection rules and IR playbooks based on new insights.

🔁 4. Continuous Improvement
📊 Security Audits and Compliance
Ensure compliance with frameworks (e.g. NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS).

Conduct internal or external audits regularly.

🔐 Security Awareness Training
Run phishing simulations and mandatory training.

Educate users on secure behavior and reporting procedures.

⚙️ Red Team/Purple Team Collaboration
Work with offensive teams to test controls (assume breach).

Tune detections and responses through purple team exercises.

📘 Playbook and Runbook Development
Document step-by-step procedures for detection and response.

Automate repetitive tasks using SOAR platforms (e.g. Cortex XSOAR, Splunk Phantom).

⚙️ 5. Supporting Operations
Backup and Disaster Recovery (DR) – ensure robust, tested backup strategies.

Security Architecture Reviews – validate new deployments for secure design.

GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) – manage policies, risk assessments, and business continuity plans.
