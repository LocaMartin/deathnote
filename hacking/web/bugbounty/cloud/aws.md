**What is cloud ?**

The cloud is a network of remote servers that store data, applications, and other computing resources. It allows users to access these resources over the internet, from any device with an internet connection.

**What is AWS ?**

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that offers services for storage, computing, and content delivery.

**What is EC2 ?**

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is like having your very own computer that you can rent and use whenever you need it. Let me explain it to you in simple terms:

Imagine that you have a computer at home that you use for doing your homework, playing games, and watching videos. But sometimes, you need a more powerful computer to do things like run a program that requires a lot of processing power or store a large amount of data.

That’s where EC2 comes in. It allows you to rent a virtual computer, called an instance, from Amazon’s cloud infrastructure. You can choose the size and specifications of the instance you need, just like you would choose a new computer to buy.

Once you rent an instance, you can access it remotely from your own computer and use it just like you would use your own computer. You can install software, store files, and run programs on the instance. When you’re done using it, you can stop the instance and you’ll only pay for the time you used it.

For example, if you’re a video game developer, you might use EC2 to rent a powerful instance that you can use to test your game on different platforms. Or if you’re a data scientist, you might use EC2 to rent an instance that has a lot of memory and processing power to run complex data analysis algorithms.

So, to summarize, EC2 is like having your very own computer that you can rent and use whenever you need it, without having to buy a new computer every time you need more processing power or storage. You can access it remotely and use it just like your own computer, and you only pay for the time you use it.

**What is S3 Bucket ?**

S3 bucket is like a big, virtual box where you can store all sorts of things like pictures, videos, and other files.

Imagine you have a big toy box at home where you keep all your toys organized. Similarly, an S3 bucket is a virtual box where you can keep all your digital things organized. You can even keep your toys safe in the toy box, and in the same way, you can keep your important digital files safe in an S3 bucket.

You can access your S3 bucket from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. This means that you can store and access your things from any computer or device that has internet access.

S3 buckets are used by many companies and individuals to store and share files and information over the internet. And just like a toy box, you can choose to share your things with others or keep them private for your own use.

**What is Lambda ?**

AWS Lambda is like having a robot helper that automatically does tasks for you whenever you need it. Let me explain it to you in simple terms:

Imagine that you have a lot of tasks to do, like cleaning your room, washing the dishes, and doing your homework. Normally, you would have to do these tasks yourself, or ask someone else to help you.

But with AWS Lambda, you can create a program that automatically does tasks for you whenever you need it. Just like how a robot helper can do tasks for you without you having to do them yourself.

For example, let’s say you want to create a program that automatically sends you an email every time someone comments on your YouTube video. You can write a program using AWS Lambda that automatically checks for new comments and sends you an email when there is one.

AWS Lambda also takes care of the technical details of running the program, like managing the server and resources needed to run it. This means that you don’t have to worry about setting up and maintaining your own server.

So, to summarize, AWS Lambda is like having a robot helper that automatically does tasks for you whenever you need it. You can create a program that runs on AWS Lambda to do tasks for you automatically, and AWS Lambda takes care of the technical details of running the program.
