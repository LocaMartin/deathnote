# Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability Report

## Summary
[ Brief description of the vulnerability ]

## Details
### Endpoint Affected
- URL: [URL where vulnerability was found]
- Method: [HTTP method used]

### Format
- Serialization format: [Format type]
- Language/framework: [Technology stack]

### Proof of Concept
```http
[Request showing deserialization exploit]
```

### Impact
- Remote code execution
- Data tampering
- Denial of service
- Privilege escalation

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Send malicious payload:
   ```bash
   curl -X [METHOD] "[URL]" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/[format]" \
     -d "[PAYLOAD]"
   ```

### Expected Behavior
- Input validation should prevent exploits
- Only trusted data should be processed

### Actual Behavior
- Malicious payloads processed successfully
- Deserialization occurs without validation

### Recommendation
Implement secure deserialization practices and input validation.
